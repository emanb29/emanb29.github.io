title: Implementing Z. Aslanyan's ADTree Model in Scala
---
## WIP
As I wrap up my senior year at Pacific University, I, as all graduating students from the program, am creating a capstone project. For my capstone, I elected to research the problem of assessing network security. In particular, the cost/probability of a successful attack on a network based on the network's structure, which portion of the network must be accessed for the network to be considered successfully attacked, and what ways of gaining privileges are present in the network. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that Attack-Defense Trees (ADTrees) provide the best model for assessing this problem (at least for my purposes), and decided to implement Aslanyan's algorithms for formally analyzing ADTrees. Being the Scala nerd I am, I opted for Scala as the platform. Today, I'd like to share with you the process of constructing and analyzing ADtrees.
