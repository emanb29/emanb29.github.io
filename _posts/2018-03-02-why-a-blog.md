title: Why a Blog?
---

This website has an odd format. Profile off to the side, a few lines of text, but mostly just empty space. Why? Who creates	a blog with no content? Well, I do. I've turned my main webpage into this blog format in the hopes of pushing myself towards one of my goals as a developer: stewardship. Early on in my career, I was a part of a brand new company still forming its identity, both its brand and its culture. We talked a lot about culture, about image, and most of all, about values. My boss convinced me that stewardship is a pinnacle virtue in the tech industry. That is, taking what you've learned and not only gaining from it yourself, but helping others to learn and gain from that knowledge.
