title: The M Word

_This article continues my eclectic collection of recently-learned-topic reviews. Essentially, when I’m in class or work and come across a topic I find particularly difficult, counterintuitive, or just interesting, I’ll write one of these to hopefully ease the learning process for the next poor sucker who needs to learn the topic. Today, I’ll be discussing monads, both in a mathematical context as well as in a functional programming context._

**Monads**. For many developers just starting out with functional programming, this word inspires despair. For good cause: the concept of a monad can be incredibly confusing (it certainly was for me!) We see genius PhD types discussing the power of monads and praising them left and right, sometimes describing them using terms like "morphism", "kleisli composition", and "applicative". The density of language used in discussing monads is one part due to their origins in complex mathematics called category theory and another part due to most of the people using them having very high IQs but not very strong social skills. As a response to this, the common approach to explaining monads is to "sneak up" on the concept, either saying "forget about the word Monad, think of a List" or building up a monad from its properties in a very particular context. While this is effective in getting the point across, the indirection makes it hard to explain later. As [Douglas Crockford said,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM) "Once you ... understand, 'Oh, that's what \[a monad\] is', you lose the ability to explain it to anybody else".
